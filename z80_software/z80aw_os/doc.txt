Calling convention:
-------------------

Return value: 

Functions that return char: in the L register
Functions that return int or a pointer: in the HL registers
Functions that return long: in the DEHL registers

Parameters:

Parameters for the function are pushed to the stack before the function is
called. They are pushed from right to left, so the leftmost parameter is the
first one found when going up in the stack.


Memory map:

FF00 - stack
F800 - globals
